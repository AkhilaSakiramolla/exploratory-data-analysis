# GDP vs Life Expectancy Analysis

We want to learn about life expectancy and its relationship to GDP per capita. For data, I have used an R package called gapminder that contains a data set of the same name giving the GDP per capita (adjusted for inflation) and life expectancy in 142 countries for a selection of years from 1952 to 2007. 

Major research questions that I answered with this analysis: 

  1) Can the increase in life expectancy since World War 2 be largely explained by increases in GDP per capita? 

  2) How does life expectancy vary with GDP per capita in 2007? Can the trends be well-described by a simple model such as a linear model, or is a more complicated model required? Is the pattern the same or different for every continent? If some continents are different, which ones? Can differences between continents be simply described by an additive or multiplicative shift, or is it more complicated than that?

  3) How has average life expectancy changed over time in each continent? Have some continents caught up (at least partially) to others? If so, is this just because of some countries in the continent, or is it more general? Have the changes been linear, or has it been faster/slower in some periods for some continents? What might explain periods of faster/slower change?
  
  4) How has the relationship between GDP and life expectancy changed in each continent? Can changes in life expectancy be entirely explained by changes in GDP per capita? Does it look like there’s a time effect on life expectancy in addition to a GDP effect? Has there been "convergence" in the sense that perhaps GDP and/or continent don’t matter as much as it used to? Are there exceptions to the general patterns?

Please refer to the Rmd file and report for detailed explanation.
