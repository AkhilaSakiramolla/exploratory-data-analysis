# Goodreads Exploratory Data Analysis

One of the world's most influential reading sites, Goodreads offers a forum for those interested in books to 
discuss them. Book recommendations are driven by word-of-mouth, and Goodreads has amplified the word-of-mouth effect. 
As an avid reader, I have always been interested in how books are being recommended 
on various platforms based on our reading history and interests. 

With this project I tried to analyze the book's information to understand the user’s reading habits and also to understand what factors lead to the 
increasing popularity of certain books. My goal is to get a fair understanding of the relationship between the multiple characteristics a book might 
have, such as the average rating of each book, the popularity of the authors over the years, and the number 
of languages it comes in 

Major research questions addressed:
  1) Understand the distribution of ratings for various books. Where do the majority of the book lie, in terms of rating?
  2) Is there a relationship between the number of ratings given and the ratings? This will help us understand if the popularity of a book is dependent on the value of the rating received or vice versa.
  3) Does the number of pages have an impact on the ratings? The aim here is to point out any impact that number of pages has on the overall popularity of the book.
  4) One of the important research questions was to observe authors’ performances over time. Are they performing the same over time, with their new books? 
  5) I wanted to know if books can be recommended based on their ratings.
