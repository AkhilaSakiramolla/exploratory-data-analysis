# US Politics Analysis

Many people studying politics in the United States believe that the country is becoming more ideologically polarized: either liberals are becoming more liberal, 
conservatives are becoming more conservative, or both. In either case, they believe that the middle of the political spectrum is being hollowed out. One way to 
investigate whether this is true is to look at the congressional voting record. 

For this, I have considered partially cleaned version of roll call votes taken by the 
Senate. In the data folder, you should get one subdirectory for each year between 1989 and 2014. Each folder contains two csvs: one giving each senatorâ€™s vote on each 
of the bills for which there was a roll call vote in that year, and one describing the senators (name, id, state, party). For more info: https://github.com/unitedstates/congress.

Major research questions I answered with this analysis: 
  1) Does the relationships between the senators look like they fall on a one-dimensional liberal/conservative axis? Are there outliers?

  2) Did the polarization increase over time? Is something more complicated happening?

  3) what are the absolute changes in the ideological positions of the parties so that we can assign blame to one or both parties for
polarization?

Please refer to the report for detailed explanation.
